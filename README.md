# Tetris-Remake
A remake of the game Tetris in Java

Controls are arrow keys, to rotate the piece use up arrow. Unintentionally, t-spins are possible, but other spins aren't possible. It's pretty bare bones so far, but the base game is in and working. I want to add the ability for a hold piece, as well as hard drops (where when you press the space bar the piece goes all the way to the bottom). I also want to make it so you can customize keybinds, as on different devices the keybinds may not work. The source code is in another branch. To run it, put the following commands into the terminal: "javac *.java" (to compile it) and "java Runner" (to run it).
